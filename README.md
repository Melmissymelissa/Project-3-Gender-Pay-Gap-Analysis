<div align="center"><h1>Gender Pay Gap Analysis</h1> </div>

<p>In my project, I dive deep into the realm of statistical analysis to investigate and shed light on the factors contributing to occupational segregation and its impact on pay disparities between genders. üíºüîç</p>
<p></p>
<p>With using the Employment and Earning by Occupation dataset from the US Department of Labor, I uncover valuable insights that will help us understand the root causes of this societal issue. By examining industries and occupations, we can work towards creating a fairer and more equitable future for all. üí™üåü</p>

<div align="center"><h2>About the Dataset</h2> </div>
<p></p>
This dataset from 2021 from the US Department of Labor is the most recent dataset that offers valuable insights for researchers and stakeholders, shedding light on the intricate workings of the gender pay gap and revealing the underlying factors that perpetuate these disparities. From scrutinizing wage discrepancies to unraveling the prevalence of occupational segregation, this data is a vital resource in the relentless pursuit of gender equality in the workforce. <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/data/occupations">Link to dataset</a>
<p></p>
<p>This dataset contains <u>337 rows</u> and <u>9 main columns</u></p>
<h3>Main Columns Include:</h3>
<p></p>
<p>1. Occupation: This column categorizes various job roles or positions within the dataset, providing a comprehensive breakdown of different occupations. It allows for easy identification and analysis of specific job roles and their associated data.</p>
<p>2. Number of Full-Time Workers: This column provides information on the total count of individuals employed in each occupation on a full-time basis. It offers insights into the scale and workforce size within different job roles, allowing for comparisons and analysis of employment trends.</p>
<p>3. Number of Men: This column indicates the count of male individuals employed in each occupation. It provides a quantitative measure of gender distribution within different job roles, enabling analysis of gender imbalances and disparities in workforce representation.</p>
<p>4. Number of Women: This column represents the count of female individuals employed in each occupation. It offers insights into the gender distribution within different job roles, allowing for analysis of gender representation and potential disparities in workforce composition.</p>
<p>5. Percentage of Women in Occupational Group: This column calculates the proportion of female individuals within each specific job category. It provides a quantitative measure of gender representation, allowing for analysis of gender diversity and potential gender imbalances within different occupational groups.</p>
<p>6. Median Earnings: This column represents the median income for individuals in each occupation, providing insights into the overall earning potential within different job roles.</p>
<p>7. Median Earnings Men: This column specifically focuses on the median earnings for men</p>
<p>8. Median Earnings Women: This column specifically focuses on the median earnings for women , respectively, allowing for a direct comparison of gender-based wage disparities.</p>
<p>9. Women's Earnings as a Percentage of Men's Earnings: This column provides a crucial metric for understanding the gender pay gap within each occupation. It quantifies the difference in earnings between men and women, expressed as a percentage, highlighting the extent of gender-based wage inequality.</p>

<div align="center"><h2>Hypotheses</h2> </div>
<p></p>
<p>1. The proportion of women in an occupational group is positively correlated with the ratio of women's earnings to men's earnings within that group.</p>
<p>2. There is a notable disparity in the gender pay gap between occupations with below-average proportions of women compared to those with above-average proportions of women in the occupational group.</p>
<p>3. There is a substantial disparity in gender-based occupational segregation within industries or occupations that have lower median earnings.</p>
