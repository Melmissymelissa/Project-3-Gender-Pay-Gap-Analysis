## Analysis
<div align="center"><h2>Hypotheses</h2> </div>
<h3>1. As the percentage of women in an occupational group increases, the median earnings of women in that group tend to decrease.</h3>

```python
stats.pearsonr(gender_pay_df["Median earnings women"], gender_pay_df["Percentage of women in occupational group"])
```
![image8](https://github.com/Melmissymelissa/Project-3-Gender-Pay-Gap-Analysis/assets/142250108/583f3737-fee7-405d-aa48-64c3bdfeceea)
```python
sns.scatterplot(x="Percentage of women in occupational group", y="Median earnings women", data=gender_pay_df)
plt.title("Relationship between Percentage of Women in an Occupation and Women's Median Earnings")
```
Based on these results, I can conclude that there is a weak negative correlation; when the percentage of women in a job group goes up, the median earnings of women tend to go down a little bit. Although the relationship is not very strong, the statistical significance of the correlation indicates that this relationship is unlikely to have occurred by chance.

<h3> 2.As the percentage of women in an occupational group increases, the gender pay gap tends to be larger.</h3>

```python
stats.pearsonr(gender_pay_df["Percentage of women in occupational group"], gender_pay_df["gender_pay_gap"])
```
![image10](https://github.com/Melmissymelissa/Project-3-Gender-Pay-Gap-Analysis/assets/142250108/593e633a-65ee-427e-8d9d-6c050600b9b8)

With, 95% cofidence, the correlation coefficient is positive (0.165), suggesting a positive correlation between the variables. This means that as the percentage of women in a job group increases, the gender pay gap tends to be larger.

<h3> 3. The gender pay gap significantly differs between occupations with below-average proportions of women compared to men, and occupations with above-average proportions of women compared to men</h3>

```python
# Spliting the data for a t-test into 2 samples
above_df = gender_pay_df.loc[gender_pay_df['Percentage of women in occupational group'] > 48] #sample of above average Percentage of Women
below_df = gender_pay_df.loc[(gender_pay_df['Percentage of women in occupational group'] < 48)]#sample of below average Percentage of Women
```
```python
# run two sample t-test
t_test = stats.ttest_ind(above_df["gender_pay_gap"], below_df["gender_pay_gap"])
print(t_test)
```

```python
#confidence interval range for the difference in means
sample_1_n = above_df.shape[0]
sample_2_n = below_df.shape[0]
sample_1_mean = above_df['gender_pay_gap'].mean()
sample_2_mean = below_df['gender_pay_gap'].mean()
sample_1_var = above_df['gender_pay_gap'].var()
sample_2_var = below_df['gender_pay_gap'].var()
#print(sample_1_mean)
#print(sample_2_mean)
std_err_difference = math.sqrt((sample_1_var/sample_1_n)+(sample_2_var/sample_2_n))

mean_difference = sample_2_mean - sample_1_mean

margin_of_error = 1.96 * std_err_difference
ci_lower = mean_difference - margin_of_error
ci_upper = mean_difference + margin_of_error

print("The difference in means at the 95% confidence interval is between "+str(ci_lower)+" and "+str(ci_upper)+".")
```

With 95% confidence, the confidence interval (CI) suggests that the gender pay gap in occupations where the proportion of women is below average is approximately $64 to $4,000 more compared to occupations where the proportion of women is above average.

It suggests that factors such as occupational segregation and unequal representation of women in certain fields contribute to the wider pay gap. These findings highlight the importance of addressing gender disparities in occupational distribution and promoting equal opportunities for women in all professions.

<h3> 4. The gender pay gap significantly differs between occupations with below-average proportions of women compared to men, and occupations with above-average proportions of women compared to men</h3>

```python
# run two sample t-test
t_test = stats.ttest_ind(above_df["Median earnings"], below_df["Median earnings"])

```
```python
#confidence interval range for the difference in means

sample_4_n = above_df.shape[0]
sample_3_mean = below_df['Median earnings'].mean()
sample_4_mean = above_df['Median earnings'].mean()
sample_3_var = below_df['Median earnings'].var()
sample_4_var = above_df['Median earnings'].var()
std_err_difference = math.sqrt((sample_3_var/sample_3_n)+(sample_4_var/sample_4_n))

mean_difference = sample_4_mean - sample_3_mean

margin_of_error = 1.96 * std_err_difference
ci_lower = mean_difference - margin_of_error
ci_upper = mean_difference + margin_of_error

print("The difference in means at the 95% confidence interval is between "+str(ci_lower)+" and "+str(ci_upper)+".")
```

With 95% confidence, there is a significant difference in median earnings between occupations with below-average percentages of women and occupations with above-average percentages of women in the occupational group. The confidence interval (CI) suggests that the median earnings in occupations with above-average percentages of women are approximately $4,300 to $15,000 less compared to occupations with below-average percentages of women.

The difference in earnings between jobs based on the percentage of men and women reveals societal expectations and biases regarding suitable occupations for each gender. These biases influence job choices and can lead to occupational segregation, where certain jobs are predominantly held by either men or women. Unfortunately, this segregation also contributes to a gender pay gap, with jobs considered more "for women" often paying less than those considered more "for men." This significant difference in earnings highlights the influence of societal biases on work and pay. It is crucial to challenge and change these biases to ensure equal opportunities and fair treatment for everyone in their careers.
